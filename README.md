# hello-world

Name is Brittney and I am currently a Manual QA Analyst.

Married with two kids. Also have four rescue dogs.

Will be a code louisville student in January. Learning code and computer science on team treehouse. Will be focusing on front end dev,  C#, and Java.

My goal is to be a super excellent QA Automation Engineer and eventually, a developer.

This sounds like a wheel of fortune contestant intro.
